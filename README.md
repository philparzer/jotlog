jotlog is a blazingly fast, privacy focused, and always offline note-taking app for movers. I created it because I needed a way to capture notes in the moment, without minimal screen time and interactions needed.

## Contributions

We're happy about any contributions. I'm not the biggest React Native expert, and this was actually the first app I've properly launched, so I'm sure seasoned veterans could find plenty of improvements or bugs.

## How to contribute

- <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/">Read up on the expo docs</a> if you're not familiar with the prerequisites of running a React Native Expo project locally.
- Clone this repo.
- Use `npx expo i` and `npx expo start` to start a local build for IOS or Android.
